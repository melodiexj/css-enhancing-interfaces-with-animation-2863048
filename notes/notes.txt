CSS Rendering pipeline:
  style -> layout -> paint -> composite
  - check out: https://csstriggers.com/

Best Practices
  - when animating, ideally only affect composite layer
  - modern browsers can animate transforms and opacity cheaply
    - other properties cause browser to perform new layout or paint (more expensive)
  - accessibility concerns
    - vestibule system: sensory info processing + spatial orientation
      --> dizziness, nausea, ...
    - consider:
      - size of motion: small > big
        - ex. parallax scrolling can be problematic
      - give users control
        - scrolljacking takes ctrl from users -> disorienting
      - use CSS prop: prefers-reduced-motion
        - detects if system has setting to minimize nonessential motion

12 Principles of Animation
  - from Disney, 'The Illusion of Life: Disney Animation book'
  1. Squash and stretch
    - irl, objects change shape as they interact with env
    - ex. bouncing ball: upon contact with ground, ball squashes shape, but stretches as it leaves ground to jump back up
    - idea: dropdown, mobile menu, zooming in
  2. Anticipation
    - small actions lead to larger ones
    - ex. athlete -preparing- to sprint(?)
    - idea: redirects(?)
  3. Staging
    - presentation of idea, draw attention to things of importance
    - idea: loading screen (esp when customized)
  4. Straight-ahead action + Pose to pose
    - straight-ahead: draw animated element frame by frame, start to end
    - pose to pose: have beginning frame, a few middle frames, and ending frame
    - pose to pose more common on web
      - define start state, end state, and keyframes
  5. Follow-through and overlapping action
    - main mass of object stops, but rest continues to move to catch up
    - idea: consider how mult components on screen relate and perhaps animate those of same "group" together
  6. Slow In and Slow Out
    - objects don't move in linear fashion, at const speed
    - idea: easings
  7. Arc
    - objects don't move in straight line, but in a bit of a curve
    - used heavily in animation, not so much on web
  8. Secondary Actions
    - support main action
    - idea: highlight main action, change icons, change text, change color on button
  9. Timing
    - affect perception and look of animation
    - idea: consider easing, timing, sequencing of events
  10. Exaggeration
    - showcase creativity; can be fun and unexpected
    - idea: for more fun brands, draw attention
  11. Solid Drawing
    - relates to 3D space, form, perspective, anatomy, and other aspects of obj
  12. + Appeal
    - combines many principles to make animation interesting + believable

Animation choreography
  - (Google's material design) relates to coordinated motion that holds user's focus while interface adapts
  - motion on web should feel natural + have focused intent
  :=
    1. sequencing + easing
      - sequencing: order designated to diff parts of animation
        - outgoing vs incoming vs persistent elements (UI)
      - easing: help elems move more natural (less mechanical)
        - built-in options in CSS:
          - linear
          - ease-in: start slow, gradually accelerate
          - ease-out: start fast, gradually decelerate
            - good for incoming elems
          - ease-in-out: start slow, speed up, slow down at end
          - cubic bezier: custom curve-defining function
            - curve defined by 4 points -> cubic function
            - common effect: smooth down start and end of motion
            - sometimes called easing functions
    2. transformations
      - specific animation of transitioning element
      - ex. CSS transform properties
        - common: rotate, skew, translate, scale
    3. focal elements
      - focal elem in transition is persistent elem that is significatnt to overall hierarchy of elem in transition
